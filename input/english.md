TMRadio is a non-commercial open internet radio station.  It streams music,
syndicated news and podcasts, sometimes there are live talk shows.  All music in
the playlist is freely distributed (Creative Commons or otherwise), the playlist
is [available at Last.fm][lfm].  Listeners can vote for music they like and
against music they don't using [a special program][app] or a regular
[jabber][jab] client.

The radio is fully automated, mostly operated by robots.  They discover new
music, build playlists, announce upcoming concerts (the ones listed on Last.fm),
play voice mail sent by the listeners, archive and publish live shows as a
podcasts, [twit][twi] and do other useful stuff.  Only free software is used to
run this radio, including [some that we wrote ourselves][oss], which means you
can set up a similar system if you like.

We have a GSM hotline (+79117003831) which you can dial and leave a voice
message which would be played online immediately and then 10 times with 30
minute intervals.

We are open for all kinds of collaboration.  Send your free music or ideas to
